# 🌋 Challenge 2.5: Add Error Checking

### 📋 Description

In the above example, we said we can assume the user will enter a smaller number first and then a bigger number, like `3` and then `10`, but what happens if they enter `10` then `3`? What happens? What if we want to tell the user they made a mistake if they do that?

For this challenge, add on to your solution to challenge`2`to check if low greater than high. If this is the case, print an error message to the user like "The range you entered is not valid" and end the program by using `return 0;`
