# ðŸŽ“Coding Club

## ðŸ‘‹ About Us

Coding club is a place where you can learn about topics in computer science from computer science students from [Vancouver Island University](https://www.viu.ca/programs/science-and-technology/computer-science-bsc).

### ðŸ¤” What you can expect

Every lesson will be made using the following structure:

#### ðŸ“œ An [unplugged activity](https://csunplugged.org/en/)

In this portion of the lesson, we teach a topic in computer science without the use of technology. Some examples:

1. Binary numbers
2. Algorithms
3. Error detection
4. Turing machines

#### ðŸ’» Programming activity

If a student would some help with a personal project or with the current lesson, there are several instructors who are ready to help. Some examples of things we can help with:

1. Javascript programming/game creation
2. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming
3. C++/Java programming
4. HTML and CSS \(website creation\)
5. Algorithms and data structures
6. And any computer science topic that a student may need help with. If we do not know the answer or how to help, we will research it and provide support in the following weeks' lesson.
