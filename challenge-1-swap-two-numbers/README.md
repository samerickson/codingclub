# 🦢 Challenge 1: Swap Two Numbers

### 📋 Description 

For this challenge, write your own program that will:

* Declare a variable to hold an integer called a, and assign it the value `5`
* Declare a second variable to hold an integer, this one called b. Assign it the value `3`.
* Print a statement to the user that tells them the value of `a` and `b` \(for example `"a: __, b: __"`\)
* Swap the values of `a` and `b`, so `b` is now `5` and `a` is now `3` \(hint: you can declare a third variable to hold one of the values\)
* Print a statement to the user that tells them the new values of `a` and `b`
