# 👩‍🔬 Challenge 3: Display Multiplication Table

### 📋 Description

For this challenge, write your own program that will:

* Declare an integer variable called num
* Prompt the user to enter a number
* Store the number they enter in the variable num
* Using a `for` loop, print the value of `num * 1`, `num * 2`, ..., all the way up to `num * 10`

So if the user enters `3`, we should print:

```text
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 4 = 12
3 * 5 = 15
3 * 6 = 18
3 * 7 = 21
3 * 8 = 24
3 * 9 = 27
3 * 10 = 30
```
