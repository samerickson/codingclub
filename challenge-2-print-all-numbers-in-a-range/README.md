# 🎯 Challenge 2: Print All Numbers in a Range

### 📋 Description 

For this challenge, write your own program that will:

* Declare an integer variable called low to hold the smallest number in the range
* Prompt the user to enter that number \(for example: "Please enter the smaller number of the range: "\)
* Using `scanf` or `cin`, store the number the user entered in your variable
* Declare a second integer variable called `high` to hold the largest number in the range
* Prompt the user to enter that number \(for example: "Please enter the larger number of the range: "\)
* Using `scanf` or `cin`, store the number the user entered in your variable
* Use a `for` loop to print all the numbers, starting with the small number the user entered up to the large number the user entered

So if the user enters a `3` and then a `10`, we should print:

```text
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

**Note:** you can assume the first number the user enters is smaller than the second number the entered
