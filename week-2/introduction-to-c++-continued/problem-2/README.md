# 🔤 Problem 2: Printing Letters

### Description 📋

This program will ask the user to enter a letter of the alphabet and then prints that letter and everyone that comes after it in the alphabet. For example, if the user enters a `w`, the program will print out: `w x y z`.

You might be wondering, how can we work with letters instead of numbers? Instead of using the data type `int`, we're going to use the data type `char`, which holds characters.

Note: You can assume the user enters a lowercase letter of the alphabet \(between 'a' and 'z'\), we don't have to worry about error checking for this problem.

### Template Links 📝

Like last week, you can choose to use `iostream` \(`cin` and `cout`\) or `stdio` \(`printf` and `scanf`\). The links to templates for both are below.
