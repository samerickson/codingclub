# 🔢 Challenge 1: Print all the Numbers in a Range \(Again?! 🤯\)

### Description 📋

You might remember that last week, one of the challenge problems involved swapping two numbers entered by the user. This does the same thing, but this time, using functions!

Like the program last week, if the user enters a 3 and then a 10, we should print: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Note: you can assume the first number the user enters is smaller than the second number the entered
