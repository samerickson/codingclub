# 😎 Problem 3: Intro to Functions

### Description 📋

In this program, we're just going to print a message to the user, but we're going to do it using something new: functions! Functions are a way for us to split up our code into smaller, reusable chunks. When we call a function we've written, the program will run that little chunk for us and then return to the spot where we called that function when it's done!

First, decide on a message you want to print to the user and add that line of code to the`printMessage`function on **line 21**. Then try calling the function again on **line 13** to print the message to the user a second time.
