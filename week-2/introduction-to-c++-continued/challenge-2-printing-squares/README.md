# 🟥 🟦 🟩 Challenge 2: Printing Squares

### Description 📋

This program will use a function to as many squares as the user wants by:

* Declaring an `int` variable to store the number of squares
* Prompting the user to enter how many squares they want to print
* Storing this number in the declared variable
* Using a for loop, call the getSize function and then the `printSqaure` function the number of times the user entered
* getSize will return an int number that we need to pass to the `printSquare` function as a parameter

**Inside the getSize function:**

* Declare a variable to store the size the user will enter
* Prompt the user to enter how many squares they want to print
* Store the number the user entered in this variable
* Return the number the user entered

**Inside the** `printSquare` **function:**

* Using a nested for loop \(like we saw in [Problem 2](https://docs.codingclub.space/problem-2-print-a-triangle) last week\), print a square using symbols of your choice
* The number of symbols in each row and column should be the number passed in as a parameter
* For example, if the value passed to the function is **5**, it should print something like:

```text
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
```
