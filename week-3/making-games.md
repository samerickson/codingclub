### 👩‍💻 How to Get Started

Making video games can be a lot of work. You need to:

* Come up with an idea for a game
* Write a story and think about what players can/cannot do in your game
* Make the artwork for your game
  * Design the levels
  * Design the player
  * Design the enemies
  * Design all of the NPC's \(Non-Playable Characters\)
* Write all the code that makes your video game work!

That sounds like a lot! But no worries! This week we are going to look at the code and level design, then you will be ready to start making your own game!
